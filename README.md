# TaurusGlider-PA0.1

Mechanical Design Yet to be made i will be Showing, the design dimensions and How variables Affect this via Equations.

I need help with the code as i'm not as good as i need to be. but will learn from this a lot.

Glider-Drone (Drone without motors or other source of energy other than thermals and wind speed) for engineering, geographical,
,traffic, security inspection to be made.

*** OBJECTIVES ***

1) General Approach to Design Variables (Weight, Drag, Lift, thrust)

2)AI Driven (Gliding Algorithm)

Its designed so it may:
+Land 
(Speed, Altitude, Angle, Ground Effect)

+Stay on the air around 400 meters
(Air Density, Air Velocity, Looking for Energy Resource)

+Movement
(Yaw, Pitch, Roll)

+Navigation System
(GPS, Altitude, Lists of Priorities)

+Inspection System
(not now)
